## What is Kubernetes

Kubernetes is a container orchestration tool that was initially designed by Google to help scale containerized applications in the cloud. Kubernetes can manage the lifecycle of containers, creating and destroying them depending on the needs of the application. In the past few years Kubernetes has become one of the most talked about concepts in application architecture, and the rise of Kubernetes signals a shift in the way that applications are developed and deployed. There are many reasons that developers should seek out Kubernetes solutions. Below are a sampling of advantages and use cases that Kubernetes posseses.

## Advantages

### Free and Open Source

Kubernetes is free and open source software (FOSS). While initially developed by Google, Kubernetes has been democratized and is now under the charter of the Cloud Native Compute Foundation (CNCF). Kubernetes is actively developed and maintained, with a number of high-profile comapnies championing its cause.

### Portable, Cloud Agnostic Codebase

Kubernetes can run on virtually any public cloud, on-premise hardware, and even bare metal. Developing applications for Kubernetes means that code is portable and distributable, allowing you to select the infrastructure provider of your choosing. Should you ever need to leave an infrastructure provider, you can be certain your application will run wherever you land.

### Optimized Resource Usage

Kubernetes determines which backend nodes a container should run on based on available resources. Kubernetes also removes failing containers and creates new ones in their place. By using Kubernetes you can rest assured that all of your compute resources are used to their full potential.

## Use Cases

### Microservices

In contrast to monolithic
